## Code
```cpp
// WAP to multiply two numbers
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int num1, num2, m;

    cout << "Enter the numbers: ";
    cin >> num1 >> num2;

    m = num1 * num2;

    cout << "The multiplication between the given numbers are: " << m;

    return 0;
}
```

## Output
If the user enters `5` and `6`, the output will be:
```plaintext
Enter the numbers: 5 6
The multiplication between the given numbers are: 30
```

## Explanation

1. **Including the Input/Output Stream Library**  
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   ```
   This library provides the functionality for input and output operations.

2. **Using the Standard Namespace**  
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
   It eliminates the need for `std::` prefix before `cin` and `cout`.

3. **Main Function**  
   ```cpp
   int main()
   {
        // Main body of codes
   }
   ```
   The execution starts from this function.

4. **Declaring Variables**  
   ```cpp
   int num1, num2, m;
   ```
   Variables to store the input numbers and the result of multiplication.

5. **Input Handling**  
   ```cpp
   cin >> num1 >> num2;
   ```
   Takes two numbers as input.

6. **Performing Multiplication**  
   ```cpp
   m = num1 * num2;
   ```
   Stores the product of the two numbers.

7. **Displaying the Result**  
   ```cpp
   cout << "The multiplication between the given numbers are: " << m;
   ```
   Outputs the product in a user-friendly way.

8. **Program End**  
   ```cpp
   return 0;
   ```
   Indicates successful completion of the program.

## Conclusion
This simple program demonstrates multiplication using C++. It helps understand how to work with variables, user input, and arithmetic operations.
