## Description
This is the simplest program written in any programming language. It prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This program is often used as a beginner's first introduction to a new language.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" ;
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

1. `#include <iostream>`: This line includes the standard input/output stream library, which allows us to use `cout`.
2. `using namespace std;`: This line allows us to use standard library functions without needing to prefix them with `std::`.
3. `int main() {}`: This is the main function where program execution begins.
4. `cout << "Hello, World!"`: This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console using the `cout` stream.
5. `return 0;`: This indicates that the program ended successfully.
